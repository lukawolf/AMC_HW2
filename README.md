# Machine Learning Programming Exercise
This pipeline presumes you are running python 3.8 in a conda environment with the packages specified in `environment.yml` or `requirements.json`.

## Running the pipeline
To run this machine learning pipeline, run `jupyter lab` in this directory and open the `Notebook.ipynb`. Then follow the instructions given within

## Results
The results are available in the jupyter notebook or transcribed from it into `results.tsv`.
